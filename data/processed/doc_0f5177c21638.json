Ideally, this is a balance between these items, and it should never be the case that information security hinders the business.  It should, of course, also not be the case that an entity takes any unjustified risks and neglects security.  The final decision what takes preference has to be taken by top management.",

A manned reception area or other means to control physical access to the site or building should  be  in  place;  access  to  sites  and  buildings  should  be  restricted  to  authorized personnel only\n- D.

To ensure anti-virus signatures are up to date, entities use automation. They use the built-in administrative features of enterprise endpoint security suites to verify that anti-virus, anti-spyware, and host-based IDS featuresareactiveoneverymanagedsystem.Theyrun automated assessments daily and review the results to find and mitigate systems that have deactivated such protections, as well as systems that do not have the latest malware definitions. Some entities deploy free or commercial honeypot and tarpit tools to identify attackers in their environment. Security personnel should continuously monitor honeypots and tarpits to determine whether traffic is directed to them and account logins are attempted. When they identify such events, these personnel should gather the source address from which this traffic originates and other details associated with the attack for follow-on investigation. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Spyware • Backdoor or commandandcontrol • SQLinjection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |",

capabilities. Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow- up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit logs far more useful for subsequent manual inspection. Such tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks. However, these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled information security personnel and system administrators. Even with automated log analysis tools, human expertise and intuition are often required to identify and understand attacks. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Unauthorized access • Tempering with information systems • Backdoor or commandandcontrol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |",

To verify that users with high-privileged accounts do not use such accounts for day-to-day web surfing and e-mail reading, security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether any browsers or e-mail readers are running with high privileges. Such information gathering can be scripted, with short shell scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, e-mail readers, and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. Some legitimate system administration activity may require the execution of such programs over the short term, but long-term or frequent use of such programs with administrative privileges could indicate that an administrator is not adhering to this control. Monitoring tools can provide such information. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Abuse of system access/privileges • Backdoor or CommandandControl • Disable or interfere with security controls • Tampering in network utilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

            | With asset inventory assembled, manyentities usetools to pull information from network assets such as switches and routers regarding the machines connected to the network. Using securely authenticated and encrypted network management protocols, tools can retrieve MAC addresses and other information from network devices that can be reconciled with the entity'sassetinventoryofservers,workstations,laptops,andotherdevices. Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should implement 802.1x and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to connect to the network. Going further, effective entities configure free or commercial network scanning tools to perform network sweeps on a regular basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify devices connected to the network. Before such scanning can take place, entities should verify that they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load history and capacities for their networks. In conducting inventory scans, scanning tools could send traditional ping packets (ICMP Echo Request) looking for ping responses to identify a system at a given IP address.

AUTOMATION GUIDANCE   | A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security configuration of systems. Some entities have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or even across entities it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemesandlanguages:CVE,CCE,OVAL,CPE,CVSS,and/orXCCDF. Advancedvulnerabilityscanningtoolscanbeconfiguredwithusercredentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensive scans than can be achieved without login credentials. The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of eachvendor. In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across the network, various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings and configurations of local machines on which they are installed. Such tools can provide fine-grained insight into unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of security weaknessesbyadministrators.

Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or evenacross entities, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF. Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensivescansthancanbeachievedwithoutlogincredentials.The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor. Also, event log collectors and incident management systems should be considered. These technologies provide log collection, normalization, correlation and analysis: they can be very helpful both to detect incidents in their early stages and to investigate incidents. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Leakage of reported weaknesses • Unsuitable reporting procedures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |",

The list of threats types are aggregated from benchmark risk registers and mapped to mitigating controls to assist implementing entities during their risk assessment process.\n\nOverall,  a  number  of  security  controls  are  needed  to  mitigate  specific  threat  types  given  the  complex nature of the threats. As such, threat types along with their corresponding mitigating controls are outlined in Table 9 below.\n\n## TABLE 9: MAPPING OF THREATS TO CONTROLS",

As a recap, sector and national level controls are designed to overcome the silos created by a single-entity approach to IA, and hence create a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. They serve as foundational elements for developing the sector and national views of IA by enabling the integration and analysis of information relating to security threats, risks and incidents, as well as the state of these Standards implementation and risk assessment outcomes.",
