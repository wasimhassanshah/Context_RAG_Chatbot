The purpose of this process is to classify Suppliers into following pre-defined segments:\n- a. Strategic Suppliers -show potential of innovation and collaboration, have a proven track record, and are some of the highest spend Suppliers .\n- b. Critical Suppliers -are critical to everyday operations and any failure by such Suppliers has a significant impact on the Entity 's operations.\n- c. Operational Suppliers -have contracted commitments that require operational tracking and delivery monitoring .\n- d. Transactional Suppliers -have minimal contracted spend with the least impact.\n- ii. Common Category Suppliers are considered as Strategic Suppliers .\n- iii. Segment Suppliers process is executed periodically, preferably once a year.\n- iv. While segmenting Suppliers, it is crucial to consider the contracted spend with each Supplier for the same period to maintain a fair comparison. Only Suppliers with contracted spend during the period of review may be considered for this process.\n- v. An SRM Specialist is assigned to segment Suppliers . To segment Suppliers catering to Common Categories, SRM Specialist is assigned from the GPO and to segment Suppliers catering to EntitySpecific Categories, SRM Specialist is assigned from the Entity managing the category.",
